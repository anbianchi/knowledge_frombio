Mrs. ___ came to see me today referred to me by my
colleague Dr. ___.  She is a ___ patient with
___ who sustained a right femoral neck fracture in early
___ was repaired with 3 screws.  Unfortunately the fracture
fixation has failed and she will not need conversion to
arthroplasty.  She is in pain and is unable to bear weight and 
we
will schedule her for surgery this ___ or ___ for
conversion to a hemiarthroplasty.  I think a hemiarthroplasty
would be a more appropriate procedure for her given her dystonia
secondary to ___ and the risk of dislocation.  I
addressed all their questions today in the clinic and we will
plan for revision that will include the removal of hardware and
conversion to hemiarthroplasty this week.  We spent more than
half the time of this 15-minute visit discussing and counseling
regarding her findings and failure of her repair, and the plan 
to
follow to address it
