findings however she has not had any surgical intervention. 

This weekend she was told to be on look out for worsening 
symptoms by 1 of her neurologist who is concerned that she has 
worsening cord compression. Over the weekend had diarrheal 
illness. On morning of admission around 4:00 she was getting

In the ED, initial vitals were: 97.9 84 133/102 16 100% RA 
PVR showed 240 cc.  
- Exam notable for: intact neurological exam without signs of 
myelopathy 
- Labs notable for:  
+ Chem 10: Na 132, K 4.2, Cl 99, HCO3 21, BUN 7, Creat 0.7
+ CBC: WBC 7.1, H/H: 11.4/33.5, Plt 313
+ Urine showed: Mod Leuk, few bacteria, 3 WBC, 2 RBC, 3 Epi.
- Imaging was notable for: Severe compression fracture of T12 
appears chronic. Protrusion of the posterior vertebral body 
results in moderate spinal canal narrowing at this level without 
effacement of the spinal cord. There is severe neural foraminal 
narrowing on the right at L5-S1. There is moderate to severe 
neural foraminal narrowing on the left at L3-4. There is 
moderate to severe neural foraminal narrowing at T12-L1 and L1-2 
on the left although evaluation is limited by motion 
- Neurosurgery was consulted who stated: MRI shows grossly 
stable fracture with retropulsion into the canal, effacement of 
the spinal cord without evidence of signal change within the 
cord. It also shows stable degenerative changes and 
neuroforaminal stenosis worst at L5-S1 on the right.
Patient can follow up with her outpatient providers for ongoing 
management. There is no role for emergent Neurosurgical 
intervention. If she chooses she can follow up with Dr. ___ 
in Spine clinic.
